Final Project Description
Partner: Colin Cury

Description and core functionality:
Our game is a lunar lander inspired video game. The goal of the game is to safely land a lunar lander on the moon. The landing zone
marked in red is where the player is supposed to land, and must use the nunchuck and board gyrometer to move the ship there and hit
the landing zone without going to fast, otherwise they will crash. The game is drawn on the LCD screen with audio playing when the
player starts, lands and crashes, and also shows a crash image when the player crashes. The player can move the ship by using the
nunchuck and board gyrometer. All sounds and images are stored and loaded from the SD card.

Task Breakdown:
Ian:
Crash image, starting/ending game, drawing ship
