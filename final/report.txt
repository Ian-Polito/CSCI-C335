Final Project Report

Tasks:
I was responsible for programming the image drawn upon crashing, starting and ending the game, and drawing the ship. I accomplished
drawing the image by finding and correctly converting an image based on how we did this in Lab 9, and created a function that would
draw the image when the ship crashed abstracted from what we programmed in Lab 9. As for drawing the ship, to simplify things and
to more easily draw something more interesting than a square box, I decided to draw the ship using the drawString function to draw
a capital A to the screen since it looks somewhat like a ship. To redraw it when moving around, before incrementing the X and Y
coordinates based on momentum, I programmed it to draw a space where the ship was then redraw it based on the new coordinates.
Lastly, to start and end the game, I accomplished this by using to while loops, one for restarting the game to base conditions and
the other as the game loop. If the ship was landed or crashed it would change the player's score and break out of the first loop
in order to restart the game. In addition, if the player crashed, the player would need to press the user button to restart the game.

Challenges:
The main challenge of this lab was getting the image to properly work along with getting the SD card to work. In addition
drawing the ship was a challenge to draw correctly on the screen relative to its X and Y coordinates.

What we could do differently: 
If we could start the project over again we would try to draw more complex terrain with a better collision system, and draw
moving asteroid obstacles to make the game more challenging and complex.
