1. 72MHz speed, 256-Kbyte flash memory, 48-Kbyte RAM
2. General Purpose I/O
4. Port E Pin 11 and Port E Pin 15
5. GPIO_Pin, GPIO_Mode, GPIO_Speed, GPIO_OType, GPIO_PuPd

Results: The main challenge of this lab was working with this new board for the first time. In
particular for working with the LED's and Button, figuring out which functions needed to be called
and what they did. Through this, I was able to learn how to initialize GPIO's for LED and Button pins,
how to set these in C, and how to configure the board's clock and in general how to work with the
STM32Discovery board.
