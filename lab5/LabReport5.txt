1. The CS pin is used to select when the transaction of data is starting or stopping. It is set to low when starting a transaction
and high when the transaction is done.
2. It is set to high at the end of the pin initializations since there is no data transaction at this point. The functions
f3d_gyro_read, f3d_gyro_write both modify CS.
3. Each peripheral will have its own CS line, in which the one that will be used at a given time will be set to low and all others
will be set to high.
4. The baud rate prescaler is set to 8, and the resulting SPI clock frequency is 3Mhz (24/8)
5. SPI is synchronous and the slave and master must agree on a transmission speed in advance. It might be useful to change the
transmission rate on the fly if there are multiple peripherals that require different speeds.

Challenges: Setting up the gyroscope drivers was challenging as well as programming the led's to visually show the gyroscope's data. Through this lab I learned to configure the I/O pins for SPI as well as configure the peripheral in order to get data from the gyroscope. I also learned how to use the led's in greater depth to visualize the gyroscope data.
