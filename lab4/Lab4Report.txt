1. Two connections are required, RX for recieving and TX for transmitting.
2. Alternate functions for GPIO pins are necessary since we are using the pins for a peripheral, in this case UART. The pins are
set to alternate functions so that the peripheral can determine the pin output.
3. Baud rate is the rate at which data is transferred.
4. We need newlib_stubs since the operating system normally does much of the work for printf, but since we are using newlib, a 
library of functions that do not rely on an operating system, the functions the operating system normally would handle need to be
handled by stubs.
5. Salae Logic Analyzer works best as a debugger when you need to see what the hardware is actually doing. For example if a pin was
not initialized the software will not doing anything and debuggers like gdb will be next to useless for fixing this issue.

Results: Some of the challenges of this lab were figuring out how to correctly configure the serial connection and using the Logic
program. Through this lab I learned how to use the UART peripheral, the serialT command with the wired board, the Logic program,
and the functionality of newlib and its stubs.
