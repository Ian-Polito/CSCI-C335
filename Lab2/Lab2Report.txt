Results:
I created a simple program to count characters, words and lines from stdin and modified the given
memory dump program with my partner.

Challenges:
Modifying the memory dump program was difficult since going into the lab I did not understand much
of how it worked and the necessary printf commands to print the data with the correct type and format. By using GDB and reading material online I was able to correctly modify the program to
output the data as specified.

What I Learned:
I learned more about how data is aligned in memory and several different printf flags and specifiers in order to print the data out correctly.
