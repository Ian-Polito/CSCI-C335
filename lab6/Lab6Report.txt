1. The advantages of using printf debugging is that it is simple and easy to debug. The disadvantages of using printf debugging is
that you need to change the printf statements and recompile each time you want to try and check a value and you do not have the
better functionality of a dedicated debugger.
2. The DC pin used by the WriteBit function must be properly set before any data is read or wrote, so the higher function
lcdWrite calls the WriteBit function before calling spiReadWrite
3. This function ensures that the chip select is deasserted, which is important because it signals the end of communication.
4. glcdfont.c has a matrix that maps its cells which contain the pixelized characters to ASCII characters.
5. The timing difference is 0.4ms and the new function is more efficient since instead of individually drawing something pixel by
pixel it is drawing entire blocks of pixels.

Difficulties: The largest challenge by far was configuring the lcd screen to correctly draw a graphical representation of the
gyroscope data, which we chose to do as a bar graph.
